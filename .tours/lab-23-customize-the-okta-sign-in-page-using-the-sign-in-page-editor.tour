For the best learning experience, you are highly encouraged to type the code in manually. \n\nTo provide a differentiated experience for learners of all types, we've included an `Insert Code` link after each coding segment. This inserts the code to the correct line(s) automatically. After you insert the code, you will still have to click `Next` to advance to the next lab step.",
