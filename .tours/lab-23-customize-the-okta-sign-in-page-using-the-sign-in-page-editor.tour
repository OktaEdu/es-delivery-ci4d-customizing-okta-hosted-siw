For the best learning experience, you are highly encouraged to type the code in manually. \n\nTo provide a differentiated experience for learners of all types, we've included an `Insert Code` link after each coding segment. This inserts the code to the correct line(s) automatically. After you insert the code, you will still have to click `Next` to advance to the next lab step.",

Click `Preview`\n\nOn the preview of your Sign-In Page, right click on the page and select `Inspect` and ensure that you are viewing the `Elements` tab and the `Style` sub-tab.\n![Inspect Elements](./.tour-resources/inspect-element.gif)\n\nAlternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `SHIFT` + `CONTROL` + `C`"

We'll make changes here first before checking the changes in the embedded Sign-In Page Code Editor.\n\nNotice that this lab step automatically points to a particular line in the HTML code. This is where you will be adding some embedded CSS to change the font color of the general text in the SIW to a pink hue that matches the Okta Ice logo. \n\nType in the following embedded CSS **or** use the `Insert Code` link to add it automatically:\n\n```html\n<style>\n    #okta-sign-in * {\n        color: #0E2D5B;\n    }\n</style>\n```\n",
